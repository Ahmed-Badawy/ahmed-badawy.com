<p>There are four types of paragraphs that you need to know about: descriptive, narrative, expository, and persuasive. A quick search around the internet will yield other types, but to keep this simple, it's a good idea to consider just these four.</p>

<p>the descriptive paragraph: This type of paragraph describes something and shows the reader what a thing or a person is like. The words chosen in the description often appeal to the five senses of touch, smell, sight, sound, and taste. Descriptive paragraphs can be artistic and may deviate from grammatical norms.</p>

<p>the narrative paragraph: This type of paragraph tells a story. There's a sequence of action or there's a clear beginning, middle, and end to the paragraph.</p>

<p>the expository paragraph: This type of paragraph explains something or provides instruction. It could also describe a process and move the reader step by step through a method. This type of paragraph often requires research, but it's possible that the writer is able to rely on his or her own knowledge and expertise.</p>

<p>the persuasive paragraph: This type of paragraph tries to get the reader to accept a particular point of view or understand the writer's position. This is the type of paragraph that many teachers focus on because it's useful when building an argument. It often requires the collection of facts and research.</p>

<p>It important to point out that many paragraphs are a combination of these four types, but for the purpose of instruction, let's consider some examples of each:</p>

<p>This is a descriptive paragraph:</p>

<p>   The lights grow brighter as the earth lurches away from the sun, and now the orchestra is playing yellow cocktail music, and the opera of voices pitches a key higher. Laughter is easier minute by minute, spilled with prodigality, tipped out at a cheerful word . The groups change more swiftly, swell with new arrivals, dissolve and form in the same breath; already there are wanderers, confident girls who weave here and there among the stouter and more stable, become from a sharp, joyous moment the center of a group, and then, excited with triumph, glide on through the sea-change of faces and voices and color under the constantly changing light.</p>

<p>This excerpt is taken from The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald. In this paragraph you can hear, see, and feel the setting in which the story takes place. When you practice writing a descriptive paragraph yourself, you should address all aspects of the physical world. </p>
